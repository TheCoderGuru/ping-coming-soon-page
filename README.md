## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

This is my first attempt of this challenge and this reiterated the following css properties


- justify-content

- align-items

- gap

- flex


Here is a snippet of how it was used in this challenge


```css

.flex-group{
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  align-items: baseline;
  justify-content: center;
  width: 30vw;
  margin-left: 42rem;
  margin-top: 1rem;
}
```


### Continued development

I plan to continue using css flexbox in as much projects as required so that I can be a bit more familiar with the various css properties that encompasses the flexbox concept.


### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks - CSS Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me with the flexbox concept and I am really glad to be recommend this article, will use it going forward.

- [MDN CSS Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This is the guide to all the css properties with an indept explanation. Definitely recommend it.
